## Setup


Laravel Mix provides a clean, fluent API for defining basic webpack build steps for your Laravel application. Mix supports several common CSS and JavaScript pre-processors.
Note: If you are using single mode ( Dark, Light, RTL ) and dont need right side drawer to change layout then please remove css link from resources/views/layouts/heade.blade.php and also remove js code initSettings(); method is declared inside into init() method in the file resources/js/app.js
You need to add these css for specific mode which you want to use in your project so there will be no any extra css files will be loaded.
